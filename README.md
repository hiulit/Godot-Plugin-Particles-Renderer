## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

- Copy the `addons/particles_renderer` folder to the `addons` folders in your project.
- Enable the plugin by going to `Project > Project Settings > Plugins > Particles Renderer > Enable`.

## üöÄ Usage

To open the plugin, go to: `Project > Tools > Particles Renderer`.

Once the plugin window is open, go to: `File > Open` to select a scene.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

### Base sprite size

The size that will used for the particles viewport and as base for scaling.

If `keep proportions` is checked, when changing one value, the other value will be updated with the same value.

### Max frames

The number of frames that will be rendered.

The renderer will remove in-between frames from the total frames to match the number set.

If `contiguous` is checked, the frames will be rendered one after another, without skipping any in-betweens.

If left unset (`0`), all the frames set in [FPS](#fps) will be rendered.

### FPS

The maximum number of frames per second which the particles will be rendered on.

### Time

The seconds the render process will take.

Not relevant if the particles are set to `one_shot`.

### Scale

The scaling factor applied to [Base sprite size](#base-sprite-size).

### Output path

The path where the sprite sheet will be stored.

If no path is set when a file is opened, the path will automatically be the same as the opened file.

### File name

The name of the sprite sheet.

If no name is set when a file is opened, the name will automatically be the same as the opened file.
